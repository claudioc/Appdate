Installation instructions
========================

SVN checkout the source.

You'll have three main directories:

- bots, where the bots reside
- webapp, where the web application resides
- docs, where the documents and the initial database dump reside

Install the web application
---------------------------

1. Download the Zend Framework.
   cd webapp/library
   svn export http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.8.1/library/Zend

2. Create a (MySQL) database and populate it with docs/appdate.dump

3. cp webapp/application/config/app.ini.editme webapp/application/config/app.ini

4. edit app.ini. There are two database configurations, the development one and 
   the production one at the bottom of the file. You need also to change 
   "bots.directory" as well

5. Add an entry in /etc/hosts with something like "appdate.local"

6. Create a virtual host like this one:
  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName appdate.local
    DocumentRoot "/home/claudioc/Sites/appdate/webapp/public"
    <Directory "/home/claudioc/Sites/appdate/webapp/public/">
        Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride all
        Allow from all
        Order allow,deny
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

You should be able to see http://appdate.local
   
Run the bots
------------

1. Be sure to have python-mysqldb installed

2. cp running.ini.editme running.ini, and edit it

3. Run the bots with ./runner.py
